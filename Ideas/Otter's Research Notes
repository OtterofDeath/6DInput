The true SpaceMouse can input rotate ±x, rotate ±y, rotate ±z, pan vertical, pan horizontal, and zoom ±, 6 degrees of freedom total.

The SpaceMouse uses 6 optoelectrical sensors to get the full 6 DoF, see https://patents.google.com/patent/US7296463B2 for a patent of their old design.

Newer versions of the SpaceMouse only use three sensors chips, but they look to still be optoelectrical. Teardowns:

For more percisce 

Options for sensing inputs are:
  + Magnetic displacement sensors
  + Optoelectrical sensors
  + Potentiometers 
  + Joysticks (limited to 3 DoF)
  + Hall Effect sensors
  + Strain guage
  + 6 DoF sensors (Detect acceleration, not position)

Some combination of sensors may be required to get a fully fuctional input device. 

One solution may be magnetic displacement sensors, or Anisotropic Magneto-Resistive (AMR) sensors, Like the HMC1501. These sensors can detect rotation and angle in a single chip.

QMK firmware may be usable for a device of this nature and supports macros, multiple layouts, and LCD displays.
