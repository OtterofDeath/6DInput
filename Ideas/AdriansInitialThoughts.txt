Provisional design ideas:

FreeCAD for the mechanical design

KiCAD for the electronics

Make the electronics an Arduino Uno shield

Single sided PCB if possible, so easily milled

Force sensing resistors in a bridge as the sensing elements

5V supply from Arduino from USB

Compatible with the Spacenav driver http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/
