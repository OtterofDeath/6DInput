# 6DInputs

## A Project to create open-source 3D printed 6 DoF input devices

Note the plural ('6DInputs' and 'devices') in the headings. We would like several designs to be created here, not just one. Anyone can either contribute a new design or improve or correct an existing one.

### Development

Please fork this repository if you want to contribute, then send a pull request.

Please put your work in one of these folders, as appropriate, or create a folder under which to put the tree of your own work:

 - `Datasheets/` - useful commercial electronic or mechanical devices
 - `Electronics/` - [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) circuit designs
 - `Experiments/` - Results of trials and experiments
 - `Ideas/` - Thoughts and brainstorming results
 - `Inspiration/` - Related projects and other online sources of useful information
 - `Mechanics/` - Mechanical designs in [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org)
 - `Pictures/` - Generally useful or interestinhg images
 - `Software/` - Software for Arduino, ESP32 etc...


We would like to reserve the folder `RepRapLtd/` for our own work, so we don't get confused...
